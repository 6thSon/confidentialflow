# ConfidentialFlow

> Composable confidential payment rails on Zama FHEVM v0.11 — amounts encrypted end-to-end.

ConfidentialFlow is a set of four smart contracts and a React dApp that implement fully
encrypted payment routing on Ethereum Sepolia. Amounts are never visible in plaintext
on-chain; all arithmetic (yield calculation, vesting fractions, balance deductions) runs
inside the FHE coprocessor.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Connect wallet and approve gate as cUSDT operator

The user connects their Ethereum wallet via RainbowKit. Before any payment can flow, the
ConfidentialPaymentGate contract must be approved as an ERC-7984 operator on the user's
cUSDT balance. This is a one-time on-chain call to `cUSDT.setOperator(gateAddress, expiry)`.
The approval is tracked in localStorage and verified against the chain so users never repeat
it unnecessarily.

### 2. Deposit — amount encrypted client-side before broadcast

When the user deposits, the React frontend calls the Zama Relayer SDK (`@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk/web`)
to encrypt the amount into an FHEVM-compatible `externalEuint64` handle plus a ZK proof, all
inside the browser. The plaintext value never leaves the client. Only the encrypted handle and
proof are submitted on-chain. The gate contract calls `FHE.fromExternal(handle, proof)` to
verify and convert this into a gate-internal `euint64` balance entry.

### 3. Route payment — recipient, encrypted amount, and routing mode

The user fills in the recipient address, the amount to send (encrypted again by the SDK on
submission), and one of three routing modes:

- **Direct Transfer** — instant confidential cUSDT transfer to the recipient.
- **Yield Vault** — funds locked for 24 hours; recipient claims principal + 1% yield.
- **Vesting Schedule** — creates a 30-day cliff / 180-day linear vest for the recipient.

External protocols registered by the admin can also trigger routing via
`routeFromProtocol(from, to, encAmount, mode)` without going through the user deposit flow.

### 4. Sanction filter and balance gate using `FHE.select` — no reverts

Inside `routePayment`, two confidential guards run before dispatch:

1. **Sanction gate** — if the sender is flagged, `FHE.select(notSanctioned, amount, 0)` silently
   zeros the amount. The transaction succeeds; the on-chain observer cannot infer sanction status.
2. **Balance gate** — `FHE.le(requestedAmt, balance)` checks sufficiency. If insufficient,
   `FHE.select` again zeros the send amount. No on-chain revert, no information leak.

Both guards are pure FHE operations — the results are never decrypted on-chain.

### 5. Funds land in the appropriate module

After the guards, `_executeRoute` dispatches:

- **Mode 0 (Liquid)** → `cUSDT.confidentialTransfer(recipient, sendAmt)` directly.
- **Mode 1 (Yield)** → transfers to `ConfidentialYieldVault`, which records the encrypted
  deposit and releases principal + yield after the 24-hour lock expires.
- **Mode 2 (Vesting)** → transfers to `ConfidentialVestingModule`, which creates a per-beneficiary
  vesting schedule; tokens unlock linearly after the cliff.

In every path, `FHE.allow(sendAmt, recipient)` grants the recipient the ACL needed to decrypt
their received amount off-chain via the Zama Gateway.

## Architecture overview

```
User → ConfidentialPaymentGate → Mode 0: direct cUSDT transfer
                               → Mode 1: ConfidentialYieldVault  (+1% after 24 h)
                               → Mode 2: ConfidentialVestingModule (cliff + linear)
                FlowRegistry   ← per-sender routing config (plaintext)
Protocol  ──(onlyAuthorizedProtocol)──► routeFromProtocol()
```

## Security notes

- Sanction enforcement uses `FHE.select` (not `require`) so on-chain observers cannot
  infer sanction status from transaction revert/success patterns.
- All `euint64` handles follow the three-rule ACL pattern: `allowThis` + `allow(user)` + `allowTransient(target)`.
- Vault claim follows CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions): deposit slot is zeroed before the external cUSDT transfer.
- No `TFHE.*` calls — exclusively `FHE.*` (FHEVM v0.11 API).
- No `requestDecryption` on-chain — all decryption is user-initiated off-chain via the Zama Gateway.
- Protocol registry uses `onlyAdmin` + swap-and-pop array management; revoked protocols are immediately denied.
